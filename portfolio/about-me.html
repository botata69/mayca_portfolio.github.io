                Hi I am Xinamayca (Mayca). I come from the
                beautiful island Aruba. I spend most of my time in
                the gym training here at the Crossfit Strijp gym.
                I love love love music hence the theme for my portfolio. I
                also love traveling and can’t wait to explore more of
                Europe soon.

                I picked media because I consider myself a creative
                person and would love to learn more about designing
                and front end development in general. I have some
                experience with designing from the orienting phase but
                looking to broaden my knowledge
                in the upcoming semester.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-text">
                I went to highschool at ColegioArubano and decided
                to pick Fontys to continue my studies with an interest
                in ict. I had it as one of my subjects in highschool and
                I loved how broad the subject was and how it is needed
                everywhere,so I will definitely find a job after my
                studies. <br> <br>

                I worked on some projects in high school but I honestly
                don't remember much, so I wasn't left with much
                knowledge. One of the reasons why I chose Fonty’s is
                because I wasn't sure which direction I wanted to pick
                to continue studying and the orientation phase really
                helped me with that choice. I now have an interest in the
                media and design and hope to learn
                and enjoy the process.

            <p class="intro-text">
                Outside of school, I love training. It's very important
                to me because it helps me distract my mind and go
                into a totally different world. I also have a job with Flink,
                which is great fun. I am a rider, which means I deliver the
                groceries. Being a rider is fun, but it is really cold outside
                right now. As I mentioned I love music. You will see me
                with my headphones 24/7. I can also play quite a
                few instruments and I do miss them back at home,
                but they have a piano here in R10, which is really nice.
