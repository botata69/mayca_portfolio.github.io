            <p class="skill-text"> 
                To help prepare for future challenges in our current project we implied 
                a well structured project plan. In this project plan we discuss the timing, 
                splitting the tasks evenly, our project scope wich is what we will deliver 
                and what we will not (Moscow), what are some risks that we will face and 
                how will we deal with that in an efficient way, how we will communicate with each other <br> <br>

                We also created a team charter. Which highlights our roles and 
                expectations from each other. Here we have our core values, group norms, 
                team roles and our own personal strengths and weaknesses.
                
            </p>

            <p class="sub-head">Background</p>

            <p class="skill-text">
                In my last project of the pizzeria my group only consisted of 2 members so we 
                did not do the planning correctly. We did create a project plan and team charter
                but due to the rest of the team members not showing up, we ended up not following 
                through with the project plan. So we did not finish the product due to it only 
                being the 2 of us and a lot of back-end work which we were not good at. <br> <br>

                I did learn from that. I want to make sure the group I have now will 
                follow through with our project plan and prepare for future challenges 
                and how to make sure it impacts the product as little as possible. 
                And I also learned how important planning is and want to make sure something 
                like that does not happen again.
