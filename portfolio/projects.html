            <p class="skill-text"> I haven't really paid attention to digital designs ever.
                So this is very new to me. Due to me not having experience studying
                digital design I don't really have a solid opinion about it. In the
                first week of media design is the first time I have ever heard of
                gestalt and it is currently the only design knowledge I have.
                Everything else I have made in the past in the design area have
                just been inspired from other websites. For the pizzeria website
                I just opened the Dominos website and looked at their design. What matters
                to me in a design is simplicity. But if the website has a creative purpose
                I like it to be very dynamic and have animations. Now that I'm studying
                media and design, I will be sure to pay much more attention to the design
                and the process behind those design choices.</p>

            <h2>Gestalt principles</h2>

            <p class="skill-text">
                In week 10 I learned about the gestalt principles. I never really thought anything
                about how websites are structured and learning about gestalt clarified a lot for me.
                Gestalt is not originally a graphic design approach, but it was quickly adapted by the
                industry, and I understand why. It is a physiological approach to how humans process
                and organize what they perceive. Applying these principles in media design helps create
                visually appealing and Effective communication between the client and the designers. <br> <br>

                some principles I have aplied in our trips prototype page
                for my current group project.

            <h2>copyright</h2>

            <p class="skill-text">
                I also learned more about copyright and fair use. Copyright is making sure to check if the license 
                on the content I want to use is okay. Just because it's on the internet doesn't mean it's free to use,
                and I have to be careful with that when making a website and using someone else’s content. But most 
                importantly, I learned that anything not created by me and that I am using, I have to provide the source in my code. 
                If it is my own work, I would also have to state that it's mine.
            </p>


            <h2>Web Development</h2>

            <p class="skill-text">
                
            For web development I learned more about project setup, web servers, development tools, comments and the structure 
            of my code and links. For our project setup, we made sure our project folders were organized and easy to access for 
            each member using git. For my portfolio website I am using a web server called Herra, which is like storage but on 
            the internet. The development tool that I am using is chrome. It is really easy to use, I can right-click and “view 
            source”, which is very helpful when designing. I make temporary changes in the design and play with the responsiveness 
            of my website. It is usually terrible, but I'm not quite there yet. For the structure of my code, I consider it to 
            be understandable for others to read.  The comments that I have added to my code are for the sources of the content 
            and for copyright reasons. And last but not least, it is important to make sure the links are done right, so it 
            doesn't lead to any dead ends.
