                    My first ever individual project. During this project it was the first time I had ever heard of figma. 
                    I started prototyping the idea I had in mind for the word game. Our assignment was to make a word game 
                    with our own twist. I decided to go for catch the cat. The concept of my idea was for there to be a stray 
                    cat on the road. And if you wanted to catch it, you would have to guess the correct word. If you guessed 
                    the correct word, the cat will be added to your collection, and soon you will be the owner of a dozen cute 
                    cats. <br> <br> The main star of the game, Bob the cat, has really built a name for himself, and how can he not? He is super cute. If you didn't guess the word correctly, the cat would slowly run away further and further into lost roads never to be found again. 
                    It was really fun to do this assignment. I learned a lot from it, and it marks the start of my designing 
                    journey. It is a great representation of how I started and where I am now.
