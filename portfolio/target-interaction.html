            <p class="skill-text"> 
                In my previous Pizzeria project. I learned how important it was to have good 
                communication between your team and your client, meeting the needs of the stakeholder 
                in a project, paying close attention to what they want and asking questions. Sometimes 
                it can be hard for me to take the stakeholders into account because I want to go my own 
                way with the project, my solution for that was to ask if my ideas were okay and if not
                 I wipe it off the table. Now for my team, I failed to have good communication and the 
                 impact of that was very big. I did not address my team members about their behavior 
                 which in this case was their absence and we were left with an unfinished product. This time 
                 our group is very open and everyone will be held accountable for not doing their part and 
                 not being present. We made sure of that with our project plan.
