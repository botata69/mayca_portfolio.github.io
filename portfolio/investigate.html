                Instead of using one of the given subjects to make our group project about. 
                My team and I decided that we wanted to solve a new problem. Now to find our problem 
                and root cause, we spent time in class researching and brainstorming.

                   A problem that we are trying to solve is that students don’t experience enough; they don’t 
                live to the fullest and often miss out and regret it later in life. <br> <br> <br> 

                Why don’t they experience enough? <br> <br> <br> 

                They cannot fulfill their desires for new experiences, 
                new connections, etc. <br> <br> <br> 

                Why can’t they do that? <br> <br> <br> 

                Because they don’t travel enough to see the 
                world and experience all those new things. <br> <br> <br> 

                Why don’t they travel? <br> <br> <br>

                Because often they don’t have enough money, time (because of school, 
                Uni or work) or they can’t find a companion to travel with.

                We identified three main challenges: limited time, tight budgets, and a lack of travel companions among students. 
                In response, we offer affordable vacations tailored to student budgets, volunteer exchange programs 
                with lodging and meals covered, and group tours fostering connections and friendships. Our prearranged 
                trips run year-round, allowing flexibility in stay duration. Our goal is to make travel easy
                and unforgettable for our users, based on feedback from our target group.
