            <p class="skill-text"> 
                When I think of personal leadership I never really considered myself to be so much of a “personal leader”. 
                But if I look back I am always looking for an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. 
                I like to think that I have a lot of potential as a person so I want to make the most of myself. 
                I am also very conscious of my choices and the consequences of my choices. I should maybe 
                make some better choices… Anyways. <br> <br>

                I don’t have a problem with receiving feedback, especially negative feedback. 
                I learn more when I make mistakes and if my team members need to hold me accountable 
                for something I will more than gladly listen and do my best to become a better team member. <br> <br>
                
                In the pizzeria project I decided to take over almost all the tasks of the team members 
                that did not show up. Which is okay, but I do need to learn how to work in a team instead 
                of taking over people's tasks and doing it myself.
