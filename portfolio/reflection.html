                <p class="skill-text"> I implimented a special page for my learning outcomest and in this page
                    I explain in detail what I have learned so far in the semester. I also added pictures in my "about me" page to make the 
                    website look more pleasing. I made sure to prototype my entire website before I start coding and it has made everything
                    much easier.

                <p class="skill-text"> In the prototypes I created, I did not include many pictures and it still looked...
                boring and not interesting. So I made sure to add pictures during the implimentation. and I was still looking for a way to 
                keep updating my learning outcomest.

                <p class="skill-text"> Going from orienting to beginning was exiting for me. I am a
                   person who requires quite alot of reassurance that everthing is going well and this was my reassurance.
                   After this grade I made sure to ask for more feedback from different teachers because as you can see I only have 
                   2 feedback points open. I continued working on my prototypes and portfolio

            <p class="skill-text"> These are feedback momenets that helped me with the deisgn choices of my portfolio. 
                I added a line to keep everything updated in the learning outcomest page. I hard coded the prototypes into website pages
                and later on, I added a dropdown menu for the learning outcomest instead of having a seperate page for it. It was 
                too little text for a full page. I positioned everthing in a suitable way and started working on the responsive design.

                <p class="skill-text"> Here is were everything took a turn... After receiving this feedback I reflected
                    on my entire portfolio and all the work I put in it and decided to change it completely. I threw out 
                    the design of my old portfolio and decided to start a new one during the christmas break.
