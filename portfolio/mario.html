                    My first group project. This one did not go so well. But as they say, “you learn more when you fail”. 
                    And we did fail to deliver a product under some circumstances out of our control. Our group only consisted 
                    of 2 members, and we worked with what we had and presented our not finished product. In this project I 
                    learned how important it is to have communication between your team members and hold them accountable, 
                    for when a task is not finished. <br> <br>



                    Our assignment was to create an ordering system for Mario and Luigi’s pizzeria due to their increase 
                    in clientele. With Mario at the cashier and Luigi in the kitchen, there was no ordering system for them to 
                    use. They would just yell back and forth at each other for each order, which is very prone to mistakes, 
                    and it bothers the customers. Me and my fellow team members made prototypes but could not bring these 
                    ideas to life due to lack of skill, team members and time.  We ended up making a website on which you 
                    could add pizza to your cart and that's about it. Anything back end was not going to happen. <br> <br>



                    After seeing what happened in this project, I wanted to make sure I have a good group that 
                    puts in the work and communicates when facing a problem and I think my latest group project 
                    “Aventura Travels” really projects that.
